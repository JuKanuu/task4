# Device management system

# Task

Create a simple device management system using C#. The system should be implemented as a console application or using some UI framework like WPF. The main functionalities of the system are:

* Add new devices
* List all devices
* Search for a device by model
* Delete a device by serial number.

Device properties:

* SerialNumber (unique identifier)
* Model (device model)
* Manufacturer (device manufacturer)
* Manufacture date (date the device was manufactured)
* Date (date the device was added)

## Showcase Your Best Knowledge

* You should showcase best coding practices and knowledge.
* Feel free to use external libraries to achieve the best results (e.g., for better user input handling, data storage, logging, etc.).
* Implement any additional features or enhancements you think would improve the system (e.g., data validation, sorting devices, exporting device list to a file, etc.).
